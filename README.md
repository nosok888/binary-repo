This is a C library for use some binary operations and converting the integer value to the binary array or binary to the integer value and do some stuff on them. You also can add some own stuff to this library.

Ok this README file so short but i think you can understand the code which locate in main lib file is "binary.h"

Also this repo contains other file such as binf.h, binmathf.h, binoperf.h, binerror.h
And include some another file such as stddef.h, fcntl.h

## Operations
1) from integer to binary array
2) from binary array to integer
3) some kind of checks of the binary array such as "Is all zero elements" or "Is all one elements"
4) some kind of operations with binary arrays such as xor, or, and, add, shr, shl, and other besides mul, div, sub
